# FootyAI
This was my very first project I did when I first started to learn Machine Learning.
The data is gotten from football-data.co.uk. It basically predicts whether both teams will score in a football match. Many algorithms were used but I find logistic regression to be best.
If want to improve the model use regression algorithms and use their prediction as features it greatly improves prediction accuracy. Also note that this isn't the final model.
